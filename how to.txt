STEP 3 - Set up a space for core po automation
-----------------------------------------
1. Download credentials.json from Asana task https://app.asana.com/0/1200050614619090/1206332168381185 or from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/10p5W7L7pNwd06cz1hm-Ofu5Nox0eohFA/view?usp=sharing

2. Save credentials.json in a folder (you will re-use this folder every time you submit the core orders using browser automation)

2. Go to the CONSOLIDATED DE VENDOR SHEET
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bN3nhB6GRyDRj2SosTvW1SRUn1lMp3SOKrVOMKVGbwc/edit#gid=1364619789

3. Quickly double-check the data entry was done correctly (correct ORDER NUMBER)

4. Click the Scripts dropdown > Create Browser Automation File to Submit Orders in Core

5. Visit download link in the pop-up, click downlaod anyway, save the file in the same folder where you saved credentials.json in step 2)

6. Run the python file you just downloaded (you may have to give the script permissions)

7. wait for the script to finish creating orders and updating the google sheet

8. If an order was unable to be created, or was created but not complete, you will be able to tell in the Google Sheet's FULL PO and PO LINK columns

9. If this is the first time you're running it or if token.json doesn't exist in your folder that you'll reuse, then you'll need to give access

ISSUES:
SOMETIMES POs ARE CREATED BUT NOT COMPLETED
